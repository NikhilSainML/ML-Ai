# News-Sentiment-Analysis
Predicting stock prices is one of the hottest topics in the Financial market. And the most interesting point of all these predictions and forecasting are none of them are accurate. Stock market and the prices of stocks change over a lot of attributes, like demand-supply, interest rates profit as well as on the sentiments of market & investors.

And News is one of the main attribute that effects stock price

In this project i have used NewsApi to fetch News for a stock
And VADER for Sentiment Analysis 

VADER however is focused on social media and short texts unlike Financial News which are almost the opposite. I included a chunk in my notebook to update the VADER lexicon with words+sentiments from other sources/lexicons such as the Loughran-McDonald Financial Sentiment Word Lists.(Refered from Jason Yip's TradeAlgo)

There are some Relationship in the Close price and News Sentiment,This Project is just Research purpose and we can make more Updates and Features to make Accurate results
